Chapter I. General Introduction:
  systems biology:
    - systems biology can provide insight into the cell
    - insights not found by examining objects in isolation
    - examples using metabolic control analysis
    - genome scale models provide deeper insight
    - includes much of metabolism and takes into account many network effects
    - make predictions based on different environments
    - give examples of FBA based research
  evolutionary systems biology:
    - use deeper understanding of the cell to predict network effects
    - examples in the literature => mainly Balazs, Csaba, and Lawrence Hurst
  summary of results in thesis:
    - estimating importance of objects in a system may reflect the selection pressures on them during evolution
    - importance of reaction in a system => gene dosage effects and sequence evolution
    - importance of metabolite => amino acid cost

Chapter II. Using FBA to estimate importance of objects in a system:
  introduction:
    - systems biology predicted effects
    - can they be used to predict selective pressures
    - estimate two measures of importance in a system
    - cost of amino acid supply to the system
      - shadow prices as precedent
    - effect of reduction in reaction rate on the system.
      - metabolic control analysis as precedent
  results:
    amino acid cost:
      - sensitivity of amino acid demand on growth rate
      - different environments => costs change depending on environment
      - correlation with other amino acid costs, and atomic content
    reaction flux sensitivity:
      - sensitivity of the reaction flux on the growth rate
      - different environments again, different reaction importance
      - compare with haploinsufficiency effects
      - compare with evolutionary rates
    discussion:
      - accuracy of these measures to in vivo conditions
      - stoichiometric rather than kinetic models
      - maximisation of growth rate may not be optimal strategy
      - comparison with previous measures
      - agreement for amino acid cost prediction
      - no agreement with evolutionary rate of haploinsufficiency
      - more accurate model will lead to more accurate predictions
      - many complex effects still not modelled
    methods:
      - description of FBA
      - amino acid cost estimation
      - reaction sensitivity estimation
      
Chapter III. Role of amino acid biosynthetic cost in gene expression:
  introduction:
    - highlight previous work on amino acid cost in genome evolution and gene expression
    - would expect cost to a factor in gene expression
    - previous work use proxies for gene expression
    - no work on using real data
    - consider all levels of the cell hierarchy where cost may a factor
  results:
    - transcriptome
    - proteome
    - metabolome
  discussion:
    - weak correlation with transcript and proteome levels
    - stronger correlation with metabolome levels
    - similar discussion that used in manuscript
  methods:
    - multiple regression
    - datasets used

Chapter IV. Is there any evidence in sequence evolution of optimisation of amino acid cost?
    introduction:
      - expect amino acid biosynthetic cost to be a force in protein evolution
      - where there is not selection pressure for function, cost minimisation may become important
      - expensive amino acids may be fixed, because they would be selected out quickly
    results:
      - compare rate of evolution of protein with its average cost
      - comparing site wise evolutionary rate with cost of amino acids
      - slice evolutionary rates by domain, gene expression, hydrophobicity, and predicted reaction flux
      - compare across paralogs to control for structure
      - intra population data if time permits
    discussion:
      - update this as results are produced
    methods:

Chapter V. General Discussion
  - Discuss the impact of the work.
  - Combining systems biology to prediction selection pressures in evolution.
  - Summarise the results of each paper again.
  - Outline future work
