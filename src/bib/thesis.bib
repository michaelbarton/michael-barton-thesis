	abstract = {Genome-wide studies have recently revealed the unexpected complexity of the genetic response to apparently simple physiological changes. Here, we show that when yeast cells are exposed to Cd(2+), most of the sulfur assimilated by the cells is converted into glutathione, a thiol-metabolite essential for detoxification. Cells adapt to this vital metabolite requirement by modifying globally their proteome to reduce the production of abundant sulfur-rich proteins. In particular, some abundant glycolytic enzymes are replaced by sulfur-depleted isozymes. This global change in protein expression allows an overall sulfur amino acid saving of 30\%. This proteomic adaptation is essentially regulated at the mRNA level. The main transcriptional activator of the sulfate assimilation pathway, Met4p, plays an essential role in this sulfur-sparing response.},

When in silico predictions of 4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83\% agreement was found between iND750's predictions and the experimental studies.

@article{digulio2005,
	abstract = {I have observed that in multiple regression the number of codons specifying amino acids in the genetic code is positively correlated with the isoelectric point of amino acids and their molecular weight. Therefore basic amino acids are, on average, codified in the genetic code by a larger number of codons, which seems to imply that the genetic code originated in an acidic 'intracellular' environment. Moreover, I compare the proteins from Picrophilus torridus and Thermoplasma volcanium, which have different intracellular pH and I define the ranks of acidophily for the amino acids. A simple index of acidophily (AI), which can be easily obtained from acidophily ranks, can be associated to any protein and, therefore, can also be associated to the genetic code if the number of synonymous codons attributed to the amino acids in the code is assumed to be the frequency with which the amino acids appeared in ancestral proteins. Finally, the sampling of the variable AI among organisms having an intracellular pH less than or equal to 6.6 and those having a non-acidic intracellular pH leads to the conclusion that the value of the genetic code's AI is not typical of proteins of the latter organisms. As the genetic code's AI value is also statistically not different from that of proteins of the organisms having an acidic intracellular pH, this supports the hypothesis that the structuring of the genetic code took place in acidic pH conditions.},

@article{reed2003,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverse datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, are becoming readily available for specific organisms. There is currently a need to integrate these datasets within an in silico modeling framework. Constraint-based models of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions. RESULTS: An expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM/GPR) has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations (GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into and out of the medium is important for maximizing cellular growth. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism than iJE660a. Perhaps most importantly, iJR904 can be used for analyzing and integrating the diverse datasets. iJR904 will help to outline the genotype-phenotype relationship for E. coli K-12, as it can account for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and fluxomic data simultaneously.},

@article{varma1993,
	abstract = {Metabolic by-product secretion is commonly observed in oxygen-limited cultures. Oxygen limitations occur because of limits in the capacity of the respiratory system or because of the oxygenation limits of the cultivation method used. The latter restriction is of considerable practical importance since it results in a critical cell concentration above which oxygenation is insufficient, leading to by-product secretion. In this study we used a flux balance approach to determine optimal metabolic performance of Escherichia coli under variable oxygen limitations. This method uses linear optimization to find optimal metabolic flux patterns with respect to cell growth. Cell growth was defined as precursor requirements on the basis of a composition analysis. A growth-associated maintenance requirement of 23 mmol of ATP per g of biomass and a non-growth-associated maintenance value of 5.87 mmol at ATP per g (dry weight)-h were incorporated on the basis of a comparison with experimental data. From computations of optimal growth increased oxygen limitations were found to result in the secretion of acetate, formate, and ethanol in that order. Consistent with the experimental data in the literature, by-product secretion rates increased linearly with the growth rate. The computed optimal growth under increasing oxygen limitation revealed four critical growth rates at which changes in the by-product secretion pattern were observed. Concomitant with by-product secretion under oxygen limitations were changes in metabolic pathway utilization. The shifts in metabolism were characterized by changes in the metabolic values (computed as shadow prices) of the various redox carriers. The redox potential was thus identified as a likely trigger that leads to metabolic shifts.2+ \u{a}},

A sequence-based framework for modeling transcription and translation in prokaryotes has been established and has been extended to study the expression state of the entire Escherichia coli genome. The resulting in silico analysis of the expression state highlighted three facets of gene expression in E. coli: (i) the metabolic resources required for genome expression and protein synthesis were found to be relatively invariant under the conditions tested; (ii) effective promoter strengths were estimated at the genome scale by using global mRNA abundance and half-life data, revealing genes subject to regulation under the experimental conditions tested; and (iii) large-scale genome location-dependent expression patterns with approximately 600-kb periodicity were detected in the E. coli genome based on the 49 expression data sets analyzed. These results support the notion that a structured model-driven analysis of expression data yields additional information that can be subjected to commonly used statistical analyses. The integration of heterogeneous genome-scale data (i.e., sequence, expression data, and mRNA half-life data) is readily achieved in the context of an in silico model.},

	abstract = {In the work presented, the changes in codon and amino acid contents have been studied as a function of environmental conditions by comparing pairs of homologs in a group of extremophilic/non-extremophilic genomes. Our results obtained based on such analysis highlights a number of notable observations: (i) the overall preference of amino acid usages in the proteins of a given organism is significantly affected by major environmental factors. The changes in amino acid preferences (amino acid usage profiles) in an extremophile compared to its non-extremophile relative recurs in the organisms of similar extreme habitats. (ii) On the other hand, changes in codon usage preferences in these extremophilic/non-extremophilic pairs, lack such persistency not only in different genome-pairs but also in the individual genes of a specific pair. (iii) We have noted a correlation between cellular function and codon usage profiles of the genes in the studied pairs. (iv) Based on this correlation, we could obtain a decent prediction of cellular functions solely based on codon usage profile data. (v) Comparisons made between two sets of randomly generated genomes suggest that different patterns of codon usage changes in genes of different functional categories result in a partial resistance towards the changes in the concentration of a given amino acid. This buffering capacity might explain the observed differences in codon usage trends in genes of different functions. In the end, we suggest codon usage and amino acid profiles as powerful tools that can be utilized to improve function predictions and genome-environment mappings.},

@article{akashi2002,
	abstract = {Biosynthesis of an Escherichia coli cell, with organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon, requires approximately 20 to 60 billion high-energy phosphate bonds [Stouthamer, A. H. (1973) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 39, 545-565]. A substantial fraction of this energy budget is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The fueling reactions of central metabolism provide precursor metabolites for synthesis of the 20 amino acids incorporated into proteins. Thus, synthesis of an amino acid entails a dual cost: energy is lost by diverting chemical intermediates from fueling reactions and additional energy is required to convert precursor metabolites to amino acids. Among amino acids, costs of synthesis vary from 12 to 74 high-energy phosphate bonds per molecule. The energetic advantage to encoding a less costly amino acid in a highly expressed gene can be greater than 0.025\% of the total energy budget. Here, we provide evidence that amino acid composition in the proteomes of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis reflects the action of natural selection to enhance metabolic efficiency. We employ synonymous codon usage bias as a measure of translation rates and show increases in the abundance of less energetically costly amino acids in highly expressed proteins.},

The first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for a eukaryotic cell, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 1,175 metabolic reactions and 733 metabolites, has appeared. A constraint-based in silico analysis procedure was used to compute properties of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network. The computed number of ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons donated to the electron transport system (ETS) and energy-maintenance requirements were quantitatively in agreement with experimental results. Computed whole-cell functions of growth and metabolic by-product secretion in aerobic and anaerobic culture were consistent with experimental data, and thus mRNA expression profiles during metabolic shifts were computed. The computed consequences of gene knockouts on growth phenotypes were consistent with experimental observations. Thus, constraint-based analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae allows for computation of its integrated functions, producing in silico results that were consistent with observed phenotypic functions for approximately 70-80\% of the conditions considered.},

@article{teusink2000,
	abstract = {This paper examines whether the in vivo behavior of yeast glycolysis can be understood in terms of the in vitro kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes. In nongrowing, anaerobic, compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis, fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2. For the other enzymes it was calculated what deviation between in vivo and in vitro kinetic characteristics could explain the discrepancy between in vitro rate and in vivo flux.},

@article{niederberger1992,
	abstract = {Decreases in enzyme activity often have little effect on the flux carried by the pathway. Similarly, up-modulation of single genes, and hence of the dependent enzyme concentrations, is frequently found to be ineffective in increasing the flux in the pathway in which the enzyme occurs. This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast, first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes, however, were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes, a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed. These findings revealed a new phenomenon, namely the more than additive effects on the flux of simultaneous elevations of several enzyme activities.},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

@article{ghaemmaghami2003,
	abstract = {The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA have greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},
