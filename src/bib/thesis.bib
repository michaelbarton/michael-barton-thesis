	abstract = {A fully compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that accounts for 750 genes and their associated transcripts, proteins, and reactions has been reconstructed and validated. All of the 1149 reactions included in this in silico model are both elementally and charge balanced and have been assigned to one of eight cellular locations (extracellular space, cytosol, mitochondrion, peroxisome, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or vacuole). When in silico predictions of 4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83\% agreement was found between iND750's predictions and the experimental studies. Analysis of the failure modes showed that false predictions were primarily caused by iND750's limited inclusion of cellular processes outside of metabolism. This study systematically identified inconsistencies in our knowledge of yeast metabolism that require specific further experimental investigation.},

@article{papp2004,
	abstract = {Under laboratory conditions 80\% of yeast genes seem not to be essential for viability. This raises the question of what the mechanistic basis for dispensability is, and whether it is the result of selection for buffering or an incidental side product. Here we analyse these issues using an in silico flux model of the yeast metabolic network. The model correctly predicts the knockout fitness effects in 88\% of the genes studied and in vivo fluxes. Dispensable genes might be important, but under conditions not yet examined in the laboratory. Our model indicates that this is the dominant explanation for apparent dispensability, accounting for 37-68\% of dispensable genes, whereas 15-28\% of them are compensated by a duplicate, and only 4-17\% are buffered by metabolic network flux reorganization. For over one-half of those not important under nutrient-rich conditions, we can predict conditions when they will be important. As expected, such condition-specific genes have a more restricted phylogenetic distribution. Gene duplicates catalysing the same reaction are not more common for indispensable reactions, suggesting that the reason for their retention is not to provide compensation. Instead their presence is better explained by selection for high enzymatic flux.},

	abstract = {KEGG Atlas is a new graphical interface to the KEGG suite of databases, especially to the systems information in the PATHWAY and BRITE databases. It currently consists of a single global map and an associated viewer for metabolism, covering about 120 KEGG metabolic pathway maps and about 10 BRITE hierarchies. The viewer allows the user to navigate and zoom the global map under the Ajax technology. The mapping of high-throughput experimental data onto the global map is the main use of KEGG Atlas. In the global metabolism map, the node (circle) is a chemical compound and the edge (line) is a set of reactions linked to a set of KEGG Orthology (KO) entries for enzyme genes. Once gene identifiers in different organisms are converted to the K number identifiers in the KO system, corresponding line segments can be highlighted in the global map, allowing the user to view genome sequence data as organism-specific pathways, gene expression data as up- or down-regulated pathways, etc. Once chemical compounds are converted to the C number identifiers in KEGG, metabolomics data can also be displayed in the global map.

@article{mahadevan2003,
	abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological significance and general source of such flux variability is further investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.},

@article{varma1993,
	abstract = {Metabolic by-product secretion is commonly observed in oxygen-limited cultures. Oxygen limitations occur because of limits in the capacity of the respiratory system or because of the oxygenation limits of the cultivation method used. The latter restriction is of considerable practical importance since it results in a critical cell concentration above which oxygenation is insufficient, leading to by-product secretion. In this study we used a flux balance approach to determine optimal metabolic performance of Escherichia coli under variable oxygen limitations. This method uses linear optimization to find optimal metabolic flux patterns with respect to cell growth. Cell growth was defined as precursor requirements on the basis of a composition analysis. A growth-associated maintenance requirement of 23 mmol of ATP per g of biomass and a non-growth-associated maintenance value of 5.87 mmol at ATP per g (dry weight)-h were incorporated on the basis of a comparison with experimental data. From computations of optimal growth increased oxygen limitations were found to result in the secretion of acetate, formate, and ethanol in that order. Consistent with the experimental data in the literature, by-product secretion rates increased linearly with the growth rate. The computed optimal growth under increasing oxygen limitation revealed four critical growth rates at which changes in the by-product secretion pattern were observed. Concomitant with by-product secretion under oxygen limitations were changes in metabolic pathway utilization. The shifts in metabolism were characterized by changes in the metabolic values (computed as shadow prices) of the various redox carriers. The redox potential was thus identified as a likely trigger that leads to metabolic shifts.2+ \u{a}},

In the analysis the authors simulate a decrease in the availability of oxygen, and examine how the shadow prices of molecules change. The authors collaborate the changing shadow price of acetate, formate, and ethanol, with the order that these molecules are secreted as the availability of oxygen changes.

@article{harrison2007,
	abstract = {Why are most genes dispensable? The impact of gene deletions may depend on the environment (plasticity), the presence of compensatory mechanisms (mutational robustness), or both. Here, we analyze the interaction between these two forces by exploring the condition-dependence of synthetic genetic interactions that define redundant functions and alternative pathways. We performed systems-level flux balance analysis of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) metabolic network to identify genetic interactions and then tested the model's predictions with in vivo gene-deletion studies. We found that the majority of synthetic genetic interactions are restricted to certain environmental conditions, partly because of the lack of compensation under some (but not all) nutrient conditions. Moreover, the phylogenetic cooccurrence of synthetically interacting pairs is not significantly different from random expectation. These findings suggest that these gene pairs have at least partially independent functions, and, hence, compensation is only a byproduct of their evolutionary history. Experimental analyses that used multiple gene deletion strains not only confirmed predictions of the model but also showed that investigation of false predictions may both improve functional annotation within the model and also lead to the discovery of higher-order genetic interactions. Our work supports the view that functional redundancy may be more apparent than real, and it offers a unified framework for the evolution of environmental adaptation and mutational robustness. 10.1073/pnas.0607153104},

	comment = {This paper is a review of applications of the E.coli genome scale metabolic model.

The authors begin by discussing the construction of a metabolic model, where the first requirement is a database of biochemical, genetic and genomic data called BiGG. This database can then, with the addition of some system boundaries, be converted to a mathematical model suitable for flux balance analysis.

The review outlines five main areas where the E.coli model has been used.
  - Metabolic engineering
  - Biological discovery
  - Assessment of phenotypic behaviour
  - Network analysis
  - Bacterial evolution

Metabolic engineering
The E.coli model is used for directed strain design. Predict genetic interventions to overproduce a required metabolite. Example interventions are to delete reactions that push flux towards the production of a metabolite.

Biological discovery
Genome scale models contain gaps, because of gaps in genomic knowledge. The model can therefore be used to make predictions about the existence of enzymes in the genome. Methods for this have been based on global topology, phylogenetic profiles, and mRNA profiles.

Phenotypic assessment
Analysis of a wild-type, perturbed, and evolved strains in silico. Make predictions of essential genes, reactions, and metabolites.

Network property analysis
Characterise the underlying structure of the network. Examples are in silico analysis of pathways and reactions under different conditions. Further examples have looked at conserved metabolite pools, coupled reactions, and the organisation of the metabolic network.

Evolution
Make predictions about adaptive evolution events. Focus on three papers by Csaba, Balazs, and Laurence Hurst. Horizontal gene transfer. Evolution of a minimal bacterial network.},

	abstract = {For most prokaryotic organisms, amino acid biosynthesis represents a significant portion of their overall energy budget. The difference in the cost of synthesis between amino acids can be striking, differing by as much as 7-fold. Two prokaryotic organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, have been shown to preferentially utilize less costly amino acids in highly expressed genes, indicating that parsimony in amino acid selection may confer a selective advantage for prokaryotes. This study confirms those findings and extends them to 4 additional prokaryotic organisms: Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae AR39, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and Thermus thermophilus HB27. Adherence to codon-usage biases for each of these 6 organisms is inversely correlated with a coding region's average amino acid biosynthetic cost in a fashion that is independent of chemoheterotrophic, photoautotrophic, or thermophilic lifestyle. The obligate parasites C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae AR39 are incapable of synthesizing many of the 20 common amino acids. Removing auxotrophic amino acids from consideration in these organisms does not alter the overall trend of preferential use of energetically inexpensive amino acids in highly expressed genes. 10.1093/molbev/msl029},

In nongrowing, anaerobic, compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis, fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2. For the other enzymes it was calculated what deviation between in vivo and in vitro kinetic characteristics could explain the discrepancy between in vitro rate and in vivo flux.},

@article{wang2009,
	abstract = {One of the few commonly believed principles of molecular evolution is that functionally more important genes (or DNA sequences) evolve more slowly than less important ones. This principle is widely used by molecular biologists in daily practice. However, recent genomic analysis of a diverse array of organisms found only weak, negative correlations between the evolutionary rate of a gene and its functional importance, typically measured under a single benign lab condition. A frequently suggested cause of the above finding is that gene importance determined in the lab differs from that in an organism's natural environment. Here, we test this hypothesis in yeast using gene importance values experimentally determined in 418 lab conditions or computationally predicted for 10,000 nutritional conditions. In no single condition or combination of conditions did we find a much stronger negative correlation, which is explainable by our subsequent finding that always-essential (enzyme) genes do not evolve significantly more slowly than sometimes-essential or always-nonessential ones. Furthermore, we verified that functional density, approximated by the fraction of amino acid sites within protein domains, is uncorrelated with gene importance. Thus, neither the lab-nature mismatch nor a potentially biased among-gene distribution of functional density explains the observed weakness of the correlation between gene importance and evolutionary rate. We conclude that the weakness is factual, rather than artifactual. In addition to being weakened by population genetic reasons, the correlation is likely to have been further weakened by the presence of multiple nontrivial rate determinants that are independent from gene importance. These findings notwithstanding, we show that the principle of slower evolution of more important genes does have some predictive power when genes with vastly different evolutionary rates are compared, explaining why the principle can be practically useful despite the weakness of the correlation.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

@article{rossell2006,
	abstract = {An important question is to what extent metabolic fluxes are regulated by gene expression or by metabolic regulation. There are two distinct aspects to this question: (i) the local regulation of the fluxes through the individual steps in the pathway and (ii) the influence of such local regulation on the pathway's flux. We developed regulation analysis so as to address the former aspect for all steps in a pathway. We demonstrate the method for the issue of how Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates the fluxes through its individual glycolytic and fermentative enzymes when confronted with nutrient starvation. Regulation was dissected quantitatively into (i) changes in maximum enzyme activity (Vmax, called hierarchical regulation) and (ii) changes in the interaction of the enzyme with the rest of metabolism (called metabolic regulation). Within a single pathway, the regulation of the fluxes through individual steps varied from fully hierarchical to exclusively metabolic. Existing paradigms of flux regulation (such as single- and multisite modulation and exclusively metabolic regulation) were tested for a complete pathway and falsified for a major pathway in an important model organism. We propose a subtler mechanism of flux regulation, with different roles for different enzymes, i.e., "leader," "follower," or "conservative," the latter attempting to hold back the change in flux. This study makes this subtlety, so typical for biological systems, tractable experimentally and invites reformulation of the questions concerning the drives and constraints governing metabolic flux regulation. 10.1073/pnas.0509831103},

@article{cakir2007,
	abstract = {A systems approach to biology requires a principled approach to pathway identification. In this study, the two nuclear petite yeast mutants K1Deltapet191a and K1Deltapet191ab and their parental industrial strain K1 were cultured in glucose-containing microaerobic chemostats. Exometabolomic profiles were used to infer the differences in the fermentation characteristics and respiration capacity of the strains. The ability of the metabolite measurement information to describe genetically different strains was investigated using a genome-scale yeast model. Flux balance analysis (FBA) of the model reveals that the objective function of minimal oxygen consumption enables the identification of the effect of genotypic differences when combined with the knowledge of the extracellular state of metabolism. The predicted decrease in oxygen consumption flux of K1Deltapet191a and K1Deltapet191ab strains with respect to the parental strain is about 80\% and 100\%, respectively, which coincides with the respiratory deficiencies of the strains. The expected increase in ethanol production rates in response to the decrease in the respiratory capacity was also predicted to be very close to the experimental values. This study shows the predictive power of the integrated analysis of genome-scale models with exometabolomic profiles, since accurate predictions could be made without any information about the respiration capacity of the strains. The FBA approach thereby enables identification of responsive pathways and so permits the elucidation of the genetic characteristics of strains in terms of expressed metabolite profiles.},

@article{goodarzi2008,
	abstract = {In the work presented, the changes in codon and amino acid contents have been studied as a function of environmental conditions by comparing pairs of homologs in a group of extremophilic/non-extremophilic genomes. Our results obtained based on such analysis highlights a number of notable observations: (i) the overall preference of amino acid usages in the proteins of a given organism is significantly affected by major environmental factors. The changes in amino acid preferences (amino acid usage profiles) in an extremophile compared to its non-extremophile relative recurs in the organisms of similar extreme habitats. (ii) On the other hand, changes in codon usage preferences in these extremophilic/non-extremophilic pairs, lack such persistency not only in different genome-pairs but also in the individual genes of a specific pair. (iii) We have noted a correlation between cellular function and codon usage profiles of the genes in the studied pairs. (iv) Based on this correlation, we could obtain a decent prediction of cellular functions solely based on codon usage profile data. (v) Comparisons made between two sets of randomly generated genomes suggest that different patterns of codon usage changes in genes of different functional categories result in a partial resistance towards the changes in the concentration of a given amino acid. This buffering capacity might explain the observed differences in codon usage trends in genes of different functions. In the end, we suggest codon usage and amino acid profiles as powerful tools that can be utilized to improve function predictions and genome-environment mappings.},

The first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for a eukaryotic cell, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 1,175 metabolic reactions and 733 metabolites, has appeared. A constraint-based in silico analysis procedure was used to compute properties of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network. The computed number of ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons donated to the electron transport system (ETS) and energy-maintenance requirements were quantitatively in agreement with experimental results. Computed whole-cell functions of growth and metabolic by-product secretion in aerobic and anaerobic culture were consistent with experimental data, and thus mRNA expression profiles during metabolic shifts were computed. The computed consequences of gene knockouts on growth phenotypes were consistent with experimental observations. Thus, constraint-based analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae allows for computation of its integrated functions, producing in silico results that were consistent with observed phenotypic functions for approximately 70-80\% of the conditions considered.},

Time and resource intensive genome-wide experimental screens can be conducted to determine which genes are likely essential. For metabolic genes, a reconstructed metabolic network can be used to predict which genes are likely essential. The success rate of these predictions is less than desirable, especially with regard to comprehensively locating essential genes. RESULTS:We show that genes that are falsely predicted to be non-essential (for growth) share three characteristics across multiple organisms and growth media. First, these genes are on average connected to fewer reactions in the network than correctly predicted essential genes, suggesting incomplete knowledge of the functions of these genes. Second, they are more likely to be blocked (their associated reactions are prohibited from carrying flux in the given condition) than other genes, implying incomplete knowledge of metabolism surrounding these genes. Third, they are connected to less overcoupled metabolites.CONCLUSIONS:The results presented herein indicate genes that cannot be correctly predicted as essential have commonalities in different organisms. These elucidated failure modes can be used to better understand the biology of individual organisms and to improve future predictions.},

Despite its relevance to human disease, neither the extent of haploinsufficiency nor its precise molecular mechanisms are well understood. We used the complete set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterozygous deletion strains to survey the genome for haploinsufficiency via fitness profiling in rich (YPD) and minimal media to identify all genes that confer a haploinsufficient growth defect. This assay revealed that approximately 3\% of all approximately 5900 genes tested are haploinsufficient for growth in YPD. This class of genes is functionally enriched for metabolic processes carried out by molecular complexes such as the ribosome. Much of the haploinsufficiency in YPD is alleviated by slowing the growth rate of each strain in minimal media, suggesting that certain gene products are rate limiting for growth only in YPD. Overall, our results suggest that the primary mechanism of haploinsufficiency in yeast is due to insufficient protein production. We discuss the relevance of our findings in yeast to human haploinsufficiency disorders.},

In particular, some abundant glycolytic enzymes are replaced by sulfur-depleted isozymes. This global change in protein expression allows an overall sulfur amino acid saving of 30\%.

@article{digulio2005,
	abstract = {I have observed that in multiple regression the number of codons specifying amino acids in the genetic code is positively correlated with the isoelectric point of amino acids and their molecular weight. Therefore basic amino acids are, on average, codified in the genetic code by a larger number of codons, which seems to imply that the genetic code originated in an acidic 'intracellular' environment. Moreover, I compare the proteins from Picrophilus torridus and Thermoplasma volcanium, which have different intracellular pH and I define the ranks of acidophily for the amino acids. A simple index of acidophily (AI), which can be easily obtained from acidophily ranks, can be associated to any protein and, therefore, can also be associated to the genetic code if the number of synonymous codons attributed to the amino acids in the code is assumed to be the frequency with which the amino acids appeared in ancestral proteins. Finally, the sampling of the variable AI among organisms having an intracellular pH less than or equal to 6.6 and those having a non-acidic intracellular pH leads to the conclusion that the value of the genetic code's AI is not typical of proteins of the latter organisms. As the genetic code's AI value is also statistically not different from that of proteins of the organisms having an acidic intracellular pH, this supports the hypothesis that the structuring of the genetic code took place in acidic pH conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverse datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, are becoming readily available for specific organisms. There is currently a need to integrate these datasets within an in silico modeling framework. Constraint-based models of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions. RESULTS: An expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM/GPR) has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations (GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into and out of the medium is important for maximizing cellular growth. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism than iJE660a. Perhaps most importantly, iJR904 can be used for analyzing and integrating the diverse datasets. iJR904 will help to outline the genotype-phenotype relationship for E. coli K-12, as it can account for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and fluxomic data simultaneously.},

In the present study, a method is developed to dissect the hierarchical regulation into contributions by transcription, translation, protein degradation, and posttranslational modification. The method was applied to the regulation of fluxes through individual glycolytic enzymes when the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was confronted with the absence of oxygen and the presence of benzoic acid depleting its ATP. Metabolic regulation largely contributed to the {approx}10-fold change in flux through the glycolytic enzymes. This contribution varied from 50 to 80\%, depending on the glycolytic step and the cultivation condition tested. Within the 5020\% hierarchical regulation of fluxes, transcription played a minor role, whereas regulation of protein synthesis or degradation was the most important. These also contributed to 75100\% of the regulation of protein levels. 10.1073/pnas.0707476104},

	abstract = {The recent availability of heterogeneous high-throughput data types has increased the need for scalable in silico methods with which to integrate data related to the processes of regulation, protein synthesis, and metabolism. A sequence-based framework for modeling transcription and translation in prokaryotes has been established and has been extended to study the expression state of the entire Escherichia coli genome. The resulting in silico analysis of the expression state highlighted three facets of gene expression in E. coli: (i) the metabolic resources required for genome expression and protein synthesis were found to be relatively invariant under the conditions tested; (ii) effective promoter strengths were estimated at the genome scale by using global mRNA abundance and half-life data, revealing genes subject to regulation under the experimental conditions tested; and (iii) large-scale genome location-dependent expression patterns with approximately 600-kb periodicity were detected in the E. coli genome based on the 49 expression data sets analyzed. These results support the notion that a structured model-driven analysis of expression data yields additional information that can be subjected to commonly used statistical analyses. The integration of heterogeneous genome-scale data (i.e., sequence, expression data, and mRNA half-life data) is readily achieved in the context of an in silico model.},

@article{deutscher2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:When analyzing complex biological systems, a major objective is localization of function - assessing how much each element contributes to the execution of specific tasks. To establish causal relationships, knockout and perturbation studies are commonly executed. The vast majority of studies perturb a single element at a time, yet one may hypothesize that in non-trivial biological systems single-perturbations will fail to reveal the functional organization of the system, owing to interactions and redundancies.RESULTS:We address this fundamental gap between theory and practice by quantifying how misleading the picture arising from classical single-perturbation analysis is, compared with the full multiple-perturbations picture. To this end we use a combination of a novel approach for quantitative, rigorous multiple-knockouts analysis based on the Shapley value from game theory, with an established in-silico model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism. We find that single-perturbations analysis misses at least 33\% of the genes that contribute significantly to the growth potential of this organism, though the essential genes it does find are responsible for most of the growth potential. But when assigning gene contributions for individual metabolic functions, the picture arising from single-perturbations is severely lacking and a multiple-perturbations approach turns out to be essential.CONCLUSION:The multiple-perturbations investigation yields a significantly richer and more biologically plausible functional annotation of the genes comprising the metabolic network of the yeast.},

@article{akashi2002,
	abstract = {Biosynthesis of an Escherichia coli cell, with organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon, requires approximately 20 to 60 billion high-energy phosphate bonds [Stouthamer, A. H. (1973) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 39, 545-565]. A substantial fraction of this energy budget is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The fueling reactions of central metabolism provide precursor metabolites for synthesis of the 20 amino acids incorporated into proteins. Thus, synthesis of an amino acid entails a dual cost: energy is lost by diverting chemical intermediates from fueling reactions and additional energy is required to convert precursor metabolites to amino acids. Among amino acids, costs of synthesis vary from 12 to 74 high-energy phosphate bonds per molecule. The energetic advantage to encoding a less costly amino acid in a highly expressed gene can be greater than 0.025\% of the total energy budget. Here, we provide evidence that amino acid composition in the proteomes of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis reflects the action of natural selection to enhance metabolic efficiency. We employ synonymous codon usage bias as a measure of translation rates and show increases in the abundance of less energetically costly amino acids in highly expressed proteins.},

We identified genes involved in ribosome biogenesis (HAS1, URB1, and URB2), protein secretion (SEC39), mitochondrial import (MIM1), and tRNA charging (GSN1).

Similarly, up-modulation of single genes, and hence of the dependent enzyme concentrations, is frequently found to be ineffective in increasing the flux in the pathway in which the enzyme occurs. This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast, first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes, however, were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes, a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed. These findings revealed a new phenomenon, namely the more than additive effects on the flux of simultaneous elevations of several enzyme activities.},

@article{segre2002,
	abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

@article{shlomi2005,
	abstract = {Predicting the metabolic state of an organism after a gene knockout is a challenging task, because the regulatory system governs a series of transient metabolic changes that converge to a steady-state condition. Regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM) is a constraint-based algorithm for predicting the metabolic steady state after gene knockouts. It aims to minimize the number of significant flux changes (hence on/off) with respect to the wild type. ROOM is shown to accurately predict steady-state metabolic fluxes that maintain flux linearity, in agreement with experimental flux measurements, and to correctly identify short alternative pathways used for rerouting metabolic flux in response to gene knockouts. ROOM's growth rate and flux predictions are compared with previously suggested algorithms, minimization of metabolic adjustment, and flux balance analysis (FBA). We find that minimization of metabolic adjustment provides accurate predictions for the initial transient growth rates observed during the early postperturbation state, whereas ROOM and FBA more successfully predict final higher steady-state growth rates. Although FBA explicitly maximizes the growth rate, ROOM does not, and only implicitly favors flux distributions having high growth rates. This indicates that, even though the cell has not evolved to cope with specific mutations, regulatory mechanisms aiming to minimize flux changes after genetic perturbations may indeed work to this effect. Further work is needed to identify metrics that characterize the complete trajectory from the initial to the final metabolic steady states after genetic perturbations.},

@article{carlson2007,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Interpretation of bioinformatics data in terms of cellular function is a major challenge facing systems biology. This question is complicated by robust metabolic networks filled with structural features like parallel pathways and isozymes. Under conditions of nutrient sufficiency, metabolic networks are well known to be regulated for thermodynamic efficiency however; efficient biochemical pathways are anabolically expensive to construct. While parameters like thermodynamic efficiency have been extensively studied, a systems-based analysis of anabolic proteome synthesis 'costs' and the cellular function implications of these costs has not been reported. RESULTS: A cost-benefit analysis of an in silico Escherichia coli network revealed the relationship between metabolic pathway proteome synthesis requirements, DNA coding sequence length, thermodynamic efficiency and substrate affinity. The results highlight basic metabolic network design principles. Pathway proteome synthesis requirements appear to have shaped biochemical network structure and regulation. Under conditions of nutrient scarcity and other general stresses, E. coli expresses pathways with relatively inexpensive proteome synthesis requirements instead of more efficient but also anabolically more expensive pathways. This evolutionary strategy provides a cellular function-based explanation for common network motifs like isozymes and parallel pathways and possibly explains 'overflow' metabolisms observed during nutrient scarcity.

	abstract = {Cellular metabolism is characterized by an intricate network of interactions between biochemical fluxes, metabolic compounds and regulatory interactions. To investigate and eventually understand the emergent global behavior arising from such networks of interaction is not possible by intuitive reasoning alone. This contribution seeks to describe recent computational approaches that aim to asses the topological and functional properties of metabolic networks. In particular, based on a recently proposed method, it is shown that it is possible to acquire a quantitative picture of the possible dynamics of metabolic systems, without assuming detailed knowledge of the underlying enzyme-kinetic rate equations and parameters. Rather, the method builds upon a statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space to evaluate the dynamic capabilities of a metabolic system, thus providing a first step towards the transition from topology to function of metabolic pathways. Utilizing this approach, the role of feedback mechanisms in the maintenance of stability is discussed using minimal models of cellular pathways.},

@article{kolkman2005,
	abstract = {The use of chemostat culturing enables investigation of steady-state physiological characteristics and adaptations to nutrient-limited growth, while all other relevant growth conditions are kept constant. We examined and compared the proteomic response of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D to growth in aerobic chemostat cultures limited for carbon sources being either glucose or ethanol. To obtain a global overview of changes in the proteome, we performed triplicate analyses using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified proteins of interest using MS. Relative quantities of about 400 proteins were obtained and analyzed statistically to determine which protein steady-state expression levels changed significantly under glucose- or ethanol-limited conditions. Interestingly, only enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism showed a significant change in steady-state expression, whereas expression was only detected in one of both carbon source-limiting conditions for 15 of these enzymes. Side effects that were previously reported for batch cultivation conditions, such as responses to continuous variation of specific growth rate, to carbon-catabolite repression, and to accumulation of toxic substrates, were not observed. Moreover, by comparing our proteome data with corresponding mRNA data, we were able to unravel which processes in the central carbon metabolism were regulated at the level of the proteome, and which processes at the level of transcriptome. Importantly, we show here that the combined approach of chemostat cultivation and comprehensive proteome analysis allowed us to study the primary effect of single limiting conditions on the yeast proteome.},

	abstract = {The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA have greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

Metabolic networks are complex and highly interconnected, and thus systems-level computational approaches are required to elucidate and understand metabolic genotype-phenotype relationships. We have manually reconstructed the global human metabolic network based on Build 35 of the genome annotation and a comprehensive evaluation of >50 years of legacy data (i.e., bibliomic data). Herein we describe the reconstruction process and demonstrate how the resulting genome-scale (or global) network can be used (i) for the discovery of missing information, (ii) for the formulation of an in silico model, and (iii) as a structured context for analyzing high-throughput biological data sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of the literature revealed many gaps in the current understanding of human metabolism that require future experimental investigation. Mathematical analysis of network structure elucidated the implications of intracellular compartmentalization and the potential use of correlated reaction sets for alternative drug target identification. Integrated analysis of high-throughput data sets within the context of the reconstruction enabled a global assessment of functional metabolic states. These results highlight some of the applications enabled by the reconstructed human metabolic network.

@article{bragg2006,
	abstract = {The elemental composition of proteins influences the quantities of different elements required by organisms. Here, we considered variation in the sulphur content of whole proteomes among 19 Archaea, 122 Eubacteria and 10 eukaryotes whose genomes have been fully sequenced. We found that different species vary greatly in the sulphur content of their proteins, and that average sulphur content of proteomes and genome base composition are related. Forces contributing to variation in proteomic sulphur content appear to operate quite uniformly across the proteins of different species. In particular, the sulphur content of orthologous proteins was frequently correlated with mean proteomic sulphur contents. Among prokaryotes, proteomic sulphur content tended to be greater in anaerobes, relative to non-anaerobes. Thermophiles tended to have lower proteomic sulphur content than non-thermophiles, consistent with the thermolability of cysteine and methionine residues. This work suggests that persistent environmental growth conditions can influence the evolution of elemental composition of whole proteomes in a manner that may have important implications for the amount of sulphur used by living organisms to build proteins. It extends previous studies that demonstrated links between transient changes in environmental conditions and the elemental composition of subsets of proteins expressed under these conditions.},

The control on the flux through a metabolic pathway or subsystem can be quantified by the control coefficients of the individual enzymes or components which reflects the extent to which the component is rate-limiting. The perturbation of an individual step is measured by its elasticity coefficient. The effect of perturbation of a single step on the entire pathway or subsystem is, in turn, measured by the response coefficient. Differential control analysis can be used to compare flux through a single metabolic pathway in a pathogen with the same pathway in its host to identify uniquely vulnerable steps with the greatest potential for specifically inhibiting flux through the pathogen metabolic pathway. The utility of this methodology is illustrated with the glycolysis in Trypanosomes and with oncogenic signaling.},

	abstract = {The advent of genome-scale models of metabolism has laid the foundation for the development of computational procedures for suggesting genetic manipulations that lead to overproduction. In this work, the computational OptKnock framework is introduced for suggesting gene deletion strategies leading to the overproduction of chemicals or biochemicals in E. coli. This is accomplished by ensuring that a drain towards growth resources (i.e., carbon, redox potential, and energy) must be accompanied, due to stoichiometry, by the production of a desired product. Computational results for gene deletions for succinate, lactate, and 1,3-propanediol (PDO) production are in good agreement with mutant strains published in the literature. While some of the suggested deletion strategies are straightforward and involve eliminating competing reaction pathways, many others suggest complex and nonintuitive mechanisms of compensating for the removed functionalities. Finally, the OptKnock procedure, by coupling biomass formation with chemical production, hints at a growth selection/adaptation system for indirectly evolving overproducing mutants. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals.

@article{sun2009,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Geobacter metallireducens was the first organism that can be grown in pure culture to completely oxidize organic compounds with Fe(III) oxide serving as electron acceptor. Geobacter species, including G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens, are used for bioremediation and electricity generation from waste organic matter and renewable biomass. The constraint-based modeling approach enables the development of genome-scale in silico models that can predict the behavior of complex biological systems and their responses to the environments. Such a modeling approach was applied to provide physiological and ecological insights on the metabolism of G. metallireducens. RESULTS: The genome-scale metabolic model of G. metallireducens was constructed to include 747 genes and 697 reactions. Compared to the G. sulfurreducens model, the G. metallireducens metabolic model contains 118 unique reactions that reflect many of G. metallireducens' specific metabolic capabilities. Detailed examination of the G. metallireducens model suggests that its central metabolism contains several energy-inefficient reactions that are not present in the G. sulfurreducens model. Experimental biomass yield of G. metallireducens growing on pyruvate was lower than the predicted optimal biomass yield. Microarray data of G. metallireducens growing with benzoate and acetate indicated that genes encoding these energy-inefficient reactions were up-regulated by benzoate. These results suggested that the energy-inefficient reactions were likely turned off during G. metallireducens growth with acetate for optimal biomass yield, but were up-regulated during growth with complex electron donors such as benzoate for rapid energy generation. Furthermore, several computational modeling approaches were applied to accelerate G. metallireducens research. For example, growth of G. metallireducens with different electron donors and electron acceptors were studied using the genome-scale metabolic model, which provided a fast and cost-effective way to understand the metabolism of G. metallireducens. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a genome-scale metabolic model for G. metallireducens that features both metabolic similarities and differences to the published model for its close relative, G. sulfurreducens. Together these metabolic models provide an important resource for improving strategies on bioremediation and bioenergy generation.},

	abstract = {A large-scale in silico evaluation of gene deletions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was conducted using a genome-scale reconstructed metabolic model. The effect of 599 single gene deletions on cell viability was simulated in silico and compared to published experimental results. In 526 cases (87.8\%), the in silico results were in agreement with experimental observations when growth on synthetic complete medium was simulated. Viable phenotypes were correctly predicted in 89.4\% (496 out of 555) and lethal phenotypes were correctly predicted in 68.2\% (30 out of 44) of the cases considered. The in silico evaluation was solely based on the topological properties of the metabolic network which is based on well-established reaction stoichiometry. No interaction or regulatory information was accounted for in the in silico model. False predictions were analyzed on a case-by-case basis for four possible inadequacies of the in silico model: (1) incomplete media composition, (2) substitutable biomass components, (3) incomplete biochemical information, and (4) missing regulation. This analysis eliminated a number of false predictions and suggested a number of experimentally testable hypotheses. A genome-scale in silico model can thus be used to systematically reconcile existing data and fill in our knowledge gaps about an organism.},

@article{mazel1989,
	abstract = {Sulphur is unique among the main elements of living cells in that it is covalently bound to biopolymers but does not occur in the biopolymer backbone. Indeed, most of the bacterial sulphur content resides in the methionine and cysteine side-chains of proteins. The growth yield of an organism under conditions of sulphur limitation could therefore be greatly enhanced by mutations that substitute Met and Cys in the organism's proteins for sulphur-free amino acids. Because the saving in sulphur would increase with such accumulating mutations, Met and Cys changes could be progressively selected. Abundant proteins should be the prime targets of such a selection. A few published observations give credence to this scenario. Sulphate permease, which is abundantly produced by sulphur-starved Salmonella typhimurium, lacks Met and Cys residues. Also, two species of marine purple bacteria synthesize more protein than can be expected from a limited sulphate supply. We now report that the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. PCC 7601 (referred to here as Calothrix) encodes sulphur-depleted versions of its most abundant proteins--phycocyanin and its auxiliary polypeptides--which it specifically expresses under conditions of sulphur limitation. Although these proteins do not take part in the fixation of sulphur, their elevated synthesis affects the sulphur budget of cyanobacterial cells. Direct evidence is thus provided that the structure of macromolecules can be subject to metabolic optimization.},
