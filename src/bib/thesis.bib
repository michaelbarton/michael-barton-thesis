@article{seligmann2004,
	abstract = {The negative correlation between the frequencies of usage of amino acids and their biosynthetic cost suggests that organisms minimize costs of protein biosynthesis. Empirical results support that: (1) free-living organisms (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucaryota) minimize the usage of heavy amino acids more than intracellular organisms (viruses, chloroplasts, and mitochondria), a result confirmed by comparing intracellular Bacteria with other Bacteria; (2) avoidance of amino acids with low impact on protein structure (Chou-Fasman indices) is greater than for those with equal molecular weight but greater structural impact: constraints on protein function limit cost-minimization; (3) amino acid weight minimization (WM) for a protein correlates positively with the protein's expression level and with its size; (4) preliminary results suggest that for different proteins, the evolutionary rate of amino acid replacements correlates negatively with WM in these proteins; (5) results suggest that WM decreases with genome-size; and (6) developmental rates correlate positively with WM (within primates and rodents), even after confounding factors were accounted for. Effects of biosynthetic cost-minimization at whole-organism levels vary with metabolic and ecological strategies. Biosynthetic cost-minimization is an adaptive hypothesis that yields a semi-mechanistic explanation for small differences in allele fitness.},

@article{akashi2002,
	abstract = {Biosynthesis of an Escherichia coli cell, with organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon, requires approximately 20 to 60 billion high-energy phosphate bonds [Stouthamer, A. H. (1973) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 39, 545-565]. A substantial fraction of this energy budget is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The fueling reactions of central metabolism provide precursor metabolites for synthesis of the 20 amino acids incorporated into proteins. Thus, synthesis of an amino acid entails a dual cost: energy is lost by diverting chemical intermediates from fueling reactions and additional energy is required to convert precursor metabolites to amino acids. Among amino acids, costs of synthesis vary from 12 to 74 high-energy phosphate bonds per molecule. The energetic advantage to encoding a less costly amino acid in a highly expressed gene can be greater than 0.025\% of the total energy budget. Here, we provide evidence that amino acid composition in the proteomes of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis reflects the action of natural selection to enhance metabolic efficiency. We employ synonymous codon usage bias as a measure of translation rates and show increases in the abundance of less energetically costly amino acids in highly expressed proteins.},

@article{niederberger1992,
	abstract = {Decreases in enzyme activity often have little effect on the flux carried by the pathway. Similarly, up-modulation of single genes, and hence of the dependent enzyme concentrations, is frequently found to be ineffective in increasing the flux in the pathway in which the enzyme occurs. This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast, first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes, however, were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes, a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed. These findings revealed a new phenomenon, namely the more than additive effects on the flux of simultaneous elevations of several enzyme activities.},

@article{duarte2004,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important microorganism for both industrial processes and scientific research. Consequently, there have been extensive efforts to characterize its cellular processes. In order to fully understand the relationship between yeast's genome and its physiology, the stockpiles of diverse biological data sets that describe its cellular components and phenotypic behavior must be integrated at the genome-scale. Genome-scale metabolic networks have been reconstructed for several microorganisms, including S. cerevisiae, and the properties of these networks have been successfully analyzed using a variety of constraint-based methods. Phenotypic phase plane analysis is a constraint-based method which provides a global view of how optimal growth rates are affected by changes in two environmental variables such as a carbon and an oxygen uptake rate. Some applications of phenotypic phase plane analysis include the study of optimal growth rates and of network capacity and function. RESULTS: In this study, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-scale metabolic network was used to formulate a phenotypic phase plane that displays the maximum allowable growth rate and distinct patterns of metabolic pathway utilization for all combinations of glucose and oxygen uptake rates. In silico predictions of growth rate and secretion rates and in vivo data for three separate growth conditions (aerobic glucose-limited, oxidative-fermentative, and microaerobic) were concordant. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study examines the function and capacity of yeast's metabolic machinery and shows that the phenotypic phase plane can be used to accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and to interpret experimental data in the context of a genome-scale model.},

@article{teusink2000,
	abstract = {This paper examines whether the in vivo behavior of yeast glycolysis can be understood in terms of the in vitro kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes. In nongrowing, anaerobic, compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis, fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2. For the other enzymes it was calculated what deviation between in vivo and in vitro kinetic characteristics could explain the discrepancy between in vitro rate and in vivo flux.},

@article{varma1993,
	abstract = {Metabolic by-product secretion is commonly observed in oxygen-limited cultures. Oxygen limitations occur because of limits in the capacity of the respiratory system or because of the oxygenation limits of the cultivation method used. The latter restriction is of considerable practical importance since it results in a critical cell concentration above which oxygenation is insufficient, leading to by-product secretion. In this study we used a flux balance approach to determine optimal metabolic performance of Escherichia coli under variable oxygen limitations. This method uses linear optimization to find optimal metabolic flux patterns with respect to cell growth. Cell growth was defined as precursor requirements on the basis of a composition analysis. A growth-associated maintenance requirement of 23 mmol of ATP per g of biomass and a non-growth-associated maintenance value of 5.87 mmol at ATP per g (dry weight)-h were incorporated on the basis of a comparison with experimental data. From computations of optimal growth increased oxygen limitations were found to result in the secretion of acetate, formate, and ethanol in that order. Consistent with the experimental data in the literature, by-product secretion rates increased linearly with the growth rate. The computed optimal growth under increasing oxygen limitation revealed four critical growth rates at which changes in the by-product secretion pattern were observed. Concomitant with by-product secretion under oxygen limitations were changes in metabolic pathway utilization. The shifts in metabolism were characterized by changes in the metabolic values (computed as shadow prices) of the various redox carriers. The redox potential was thus identified as a likely trigger that leads to metabolic shifts.2+ \u{a}},

Decreasing oxygen supply, given a fixed glucose supply, means that sugars cannot be fully reduced and are instead secreted as by products. The authors use an E.coli FBA model to estimate the shadow prices of various molecules involved in glycolysis/TCA cycle. The shadow prices is defined as the effect on growth of a small increase in the availability of a given molecule.

In the analysis the authors simulate a decrease in the availability of oxygen, and examine how the shadow prices of molecules change. The authors collaborate the changing shadow price of acetate, formate, and ethanol, with the order that these molecules are secreted as the availability of oxygen changes. The authors break oxygen dependent metabolic effects of E.coli into five distinct stages based on the changing slope of simulated E.coli growth, and the corresponding change in shadow prices.},
